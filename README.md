# OpenGL-Raycaster_v2 (Processing version)

This is my port of 3DSage's OpenGL Raycaster Engine v2 written in Processing. It seems to work well, however there were some tweaks that I had to make to the math that I'm not certain why were needed. The code also might not be as optimized as it could be, but as long as I have a decently running engine, I'm considering this a success.
